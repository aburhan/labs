# Lab: Scalable Runtime Management, SLI, SLOs

## Overview

Welcome to this lab, this lab guides you through setting up a scalable runtime environment using [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine?hl=en#manage-multi-cluster-infrastructure), GKE Enterprise Fleet, and Cloud Service Mesh (CSM). You will deploy a microservices application (Online Boutique) across multiple GKE clusters, manage them using Fleet, and secure and observe inter-service communication with CSM.

## Lab

In this lab, you will take on two personas: <strong>Platform Engineer</strong> and <strong>Developer</strong>.
This project represents the live, production environment. Platform Engineers will deploy and manage resources within this project, while Developers will have access to monitor and verify the deployed applications and infrastructure.
This project will be used by both Platform Engineer![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png) who will deploy resources, and Developer ![usr2](img/qwiklabs-icons2-small.drawio.png) will access the resources.

## Task 1. Prepare your environment (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

In this task, you create separate Chrome profiles for each persona and start the lab.

This lab includes navigating between multiple projects and multiple user personas. To simplify navigating between projects setup environment variables

1. Sign in using the Platform Engineer username {{{ user_1.username }}} and password {{{ user_1.password }}}

2. On the Google Cloud console title bar, click **Activate Cloud shell**
   ![Activate Cloud Shell](img/cloudshell.png)

## Task 2. Configure your project in Cloud Shell (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

In this task, you set environment variables and clone the sample repositories.

1. In Cloudshell, set environment variables

   <ql-code-block language="bash" templated>
   export HOST_PROJECT_ID={{{project_1.project_id|'[HOST_PROJECT_ID]'}}}
   export REGION={{{project_1.default_region|'[REGION]'}}}
   export USER_EMAIL={{{user_1.username|['PLATFORM_ENG_PERSONA_EMAIL]'}}}
   export USER={{{user_1.local_username|['PLATFORM_ENG_PERSONA_USERNAME]'}}}
   export DEST_REPO=app-repo
   </ql-code-block>

2. Clone the infrastructure and application repos:

   ```sh
   gcloud source repos clone scalable-runtime-management --project=qwiklabs-resources
   gcloud source repos create "$DEST_REPO" --project="$HOST_PROJECT_ID"
   cd scalable-runtime-management && git checkout main && cd ../
   gcloud source repos clone "$DEST_REPO" --project="$HOST_PROJECT_ID" && cd $DEST_REPO
   ```

3. Copy the starter files and push your initial commit:

   ```sh
    git config user.email "$USER_EMAIL"
    git config user.name "$USER"
    ../scalable-runtime-management/repo-setup.sh
   ```

   The `repo-setup.sh` script creates two branch `app` and `infra`. As the platform engineer, you will use the `infra` branch to setup the infrastructure resources.

## Task 3. Grant access to the Developer user in the service project (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

In this task, you will grant access to the Developer to update the application in the`SERVICE PROJECT` and you will also grant access to the `HOST PROJECT` to create resources in the `SERVICE PROJECT.

1. In the `Host Project`, set environment variables

   <ql-code-block language="bash" templated>
   export SERVICE_PROJECT_ID={{{project_2.project_id|'[SERVICE PROJECT_ID]'}}}
   export DEVELOPER_EMAIL={{{user_2.username|['DEVELOPER_EMAIL]'}}}
   </ql-code-block>

2. Grant the following roles to the Developer in the service project to allow the developer to update the repository and cluster and run operations as the service account:

   - `roles/source.writer`
   - `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser`
   - `roles/container.developer`

   ```sh
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID --member="user:$DEVELOPER_EMAIL" --role=roles/source.writer
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID --member="user:$DEVELOPER_EMAIL" --role=roles/iam.serviceAccountUser
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID --member="user:$DEVELOPER_EMAIL" --role=roles/container.developer
   ```

3. Add `HOST PROJECT` service account to create resources in the `SERVICE PROJECT` and grant access role`roles/owner`

   ```sh
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID \
   --member="serviceAccount:prod-sa@$HOST_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
   --role=roles/owner
   ```

## Task 4. Create Terraform Cloud Build trigger (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

In this task, you configure a Cloud Build trigger in the `Host Project` to create the infrastructure necessary to deploy the application.

1. In Cloud Shell, set your bucket variable

   ```sh
   export TF_BUCKET_NAME=tf-${HOST_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

2. Create a Cloud Build triggers:

   ```sh
   gcloud builds triggers create manual --name="cloud-build-trigger" \
   --description="Initial cloud build trigger." \
   --service-account="projects/$HOST_PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/prod-sa@$HOST_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
   --repo="https://source.developers.google.com/p/$HOST_PROJECT_ID/r/app-repo" \
   --repo-type=CLOUD_SOURCE_REPOSITORIES \
   --region=$REGION \
   --branch="infra" \
   --build-config="infra/terraform/env/cloud-build/cloud-build.yaml" \
   --substitutions=_ENV=prod,_HOST_PROJECT_ID=$HOST_PROJECT_ID,_REPO_NAME=app-repo,_SERVICE_PROJECT_ID=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID,_TF_BUCKET_NAME=$TF_BUCKET_NAME
   ```

3. Run the below command to create the inital triggers.

   ```sh
   gcloud builds triggers run cloud-build-trigger --project=$HOST_PROJECT_ID --branch=infra --region=$REGION
   ```

   This trigger creates the following Cloud Build triggers:

   | Trigger                                  | Description                                                                    |
   | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | cloud-deploy-trigger                     | Creates the releases and pipelines for continuous delivery.                    |
   | docker-build-push-trigger                | Builds & pushes the container image to the Artifact Registry                   |
   | host-application-deployment-trigger      | Deploys the application in host project's cluster qwiklabs-database-1-cluster" |
   | infra-deploy-trigger                     | Deploys the infrastructure for the application.                                |
   | productcatalog-cicd-trigger              | Run the CI/CD process for the product catalog service                          |
   | service-1-application-deployment-trigger | Deploys the application to  cluster qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster"              |
   | service-2-application-deployment-trigger | Deploys the application to  cluster qwiklabs-developer-2-cluster"              |

4. Run the `infra-deploy-trigger` to create base infrastructure

   ```sh
   gcloud builds triggers run infra-deploy-trigger --branch=infra --region=$REGION
   ```

   This Terraform script will creates resources as a base infrastructure for the `Service Project` the developer will utilize to deploy the sample application. Some shared or supporting resources will also be configured in the `Host Project` to facilitate this environment. The following key components will be provisioned:

   - Activation of essential Google Cloud services and APIs across both host and service projects.
   - A dedicated and secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network within the Service Project, complete with subnets, firewall rules, and a Cloud NAT gateway.
   - Specific service accounts and custom IAM roles with appropriate permissions established in both the host and service projects.
   - A private Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster within the Service Project to host applications.
   - Artifact Registry repositories in the Host Project for storing and managing software packages.

5. Navigate to the <strong>[Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview)</strong> using <strong>Navigate Menu</strong> .
6. Click on <strong>history</strong>.
7. You can find the <strong>cloud-build-trigger</strong> logs.

<img src="img/cloudbuildtriggerlogs.png" alt="LOGS" width="500"> <br>

<ql-infobox>
<strong>Note:</strong> This step creates the remaining [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers) triggers responsible for setting up the infrastructure, build and push docker image for Online Boutique Application, and deploying it.
</ql-infobox>

## Task 5. Verify Deployed Resources (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

In this task you will verify all resources that where deployed in the `Service Project`

- The `infra-deploy-trigger` Cloud Build trigger has successfully provisioned all necessary infrastructure resources in both the host and service projects.

1. Verify provisioned GKE clusters in the service project.

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters list --project=${SERVICE_PROJECT_ID}
   ```

   Example output:

   ```sh

2. Verify the Cloud Deploy pipeline created by the `cloud-deploy-trigger` in the `Service Project`.

   ```sh
   gcloud deploy delivery-pipelines describe qwiklabs-delivery-service-pipeline \
   --project=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID \
   --region=$REGION
   ```

   Example output similar to:

   ```sh
   Delivery Pipeline:
      description: main application pipeline
      ...
      serialPipeline:
         stages:
         - targetId: target-1
         - targetId: target-2
      ...
      Targets:
      - Target: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-00-bed84b592c08/locations/us-central1/targets/target-1
      - Target: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-00-bed84b592c08/locations/us-central1/targets/target-2
   ```

   The pipeline deploy the application code to the two targets `target-1` and `target-2`.

3. Verify the targets `target-1` and `target-2` point to the gke cluster verified in the previous steps

   ```sh
   gcloud deploy targets describe target-1 \
      --region=$REGION --project=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID  \
      --format='table(Target.targetId, Target.description, Target.gke.cluster)' 

   gcloud deploy targets describe target-2 \
      --region=$REGION --project=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID  \
      --format='table(Target.targetId, Target.description, Target.gke.cluster)'
   ```

   Example out will be similar to:

   ```sh
   TARGET_ID: target-1
   DESCRIPTION: development 1 cluster
   CLUSTER: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-00-bed84b592c08/locations/us-central1/clusters/qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster

   TARGET_ID: target-2
   DESCRIPTION: development cluster 2
   CLUSTER: projects/qwiklabs-gcp-00-bed84b592c08/locations/us-central1/clusters/qwiklabs-developer-2-cluster
   ```

The Cloud Deploy pipeline whill push application code to both of the GKE clusters. Next, you will setup multiclusters and service mesh

## Task 6. Setting Up GKE Fleet Management and Service Mesh (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

As a Platform Engineer, establishing a well-configured Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) environment with fleet management and a service mesh is key to enhancing developer productivity and streamlining operations. The following gcloud commands will guide you through setting up the necessary APIs, configuring a fleet, and enabling a service mesh. This foundational work is vital as it provides a standardized and resilient platform, abstracting complexities of multi-cluster management and inter-service communication, which ultimately makes developers' jobs significantly easier.

1. Enable Required APIs necessary for GKE, fleet management, and service mesh in the `Service Project`

   ```sh
   gcloud services enable \
    multiclusterservicediscovery.googleapis.com \
    gkehub.googleapis.com \
    container.googleapis.com \
    cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com \
    trafficdirector.googleapis.com \
    dns.googleapis.com \
    --project=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   ```

2. Enable Fleet Mesh Feature in the `Service Project`

   ```sh
   gcloud container fleet mesh enable --project=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   ```

3. Enable Multi-Cluster Services (MCS) in the `Service Project` to allow service discovery and communication across your GKE clusters within the fleet

   ```sh
   gcloud container fleet multi-cluster-services enable \
    --project $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID

   ```

4. Register first GKE Cluster `qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster` to the fleet and enable workload idenity.

   ```sh
   gcloud container fleet memberships register qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster \
    --gke-cluster $REGION/qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster \
    --enable-workload-identity \
    --project $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   ```

5. Register second GKE Cluster `qwiklabs-developer-2-cluster` to the fleet and enable workload idenity.

   ```sh
   gcloud container fleet memberships register qwiklabs-developer-2-cluster \
    --gke-cluster $REGION/qwiklabs-developer-2-cluster \
    --enable-workload-identity \
    --project $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   ```

6. Grant Network Viewer Role to MCS Importer to allow the Multi-Cluster Services importer service account the necessary network viewing permissions within your `Service Project`:

   ```sh
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID \
    --member "serviceAccount:$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[gke-mcs/gke-mcs-importer]" \
    --role "roles/compute.networkViewer"
   ```

7. Configure mesh management to be automatic for the first registered cluster membership

   ```sh
   gcloud container fleet mesh update --management automatic --memberships qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster --project=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   ```

8. Configure mesh management to be automatic for the second registered cluster membership

   ```sh
   gcloud container fleet mesh update --management automatic --memberships qwiklabs-developer-2-cluster --project=$SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   ```

<ql-infobox>
<strong>Note:</strong>Wait for any mesh provisioning activities triggered by the above steps to complete successfully.
</ql-infobox>

With the core GKE fleet and service mesh infrastructure now configured by the Platform Engineer, the clusters are part of a managed collective. The next crucial phase, also typically handled by the Platform Engineer, involves preparing these individual GKE clusters for direct developer use. This includes setting up command-line access and creating Istio-enabled namespaces, ensuring developers have secure and ready-to-use environments for their applications.

## Task 7. Prepare Developer GKE Clusters (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

With the GKE fleet and service mesh established, the Platform Engineer now finalizes the individual GKE clusters for developer deployments. This task involves accessing each cluster and setting up application namespaces with Istio sidecar injection enabled, which simplifies service mesh adoption for developers.

1. Configure kubectl to interact with your first developer GKE cluster (e.g., qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster in us-central1). Adjust the cluster name and region as needed:

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster --region $REGION --project $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   ```

2. Create a dedicated namespace (e.g., dev-1) for applications in the first cluster:

   ```sh
   kubectl create ns dev-1
   ```

3. Enable automatic Istio sidecar injection for deployed workloads within that namespace:

   ```sh
   kubectl label namespace dev-1 istio-injection=enabled
   ```

4. Configure kubectl to interact with your second developer GKE cluster (e.g., qwiklabs-developer-2-cluster in us-central1). Adjust the cluster name and region as needed:

   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials qwiklabs-developer-2-cluster --region $REGION --project $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   ```

5. Create a dedicated namespace (e.g., dev-1) for applications in the second cluster. You can use the same namespace name as in Cluster 1, as namespaces are distinct per cluster:

   ```sh
   kubectl create ns dev-1
   ```

6. Label the namespace in the second cluster to enable automatic Istio sidecar injection:

   ```sh
   kubectl label namespace dev-1 istio-injection=enabled
   ```

## Task 8. Docker Build & Push to Artifact Registry (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

In this step, you will build and push the Docker image to artifact registry and configuring GKE for service mesh.

```sh
gcloud builds triggers run docker-build-push-trigger --project=$HOST_PROJECT_ID --branch=app --region=$REGION
```

| Trigger                     | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Duration      |

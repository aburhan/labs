# Developer Experience

## Overview
Welcome to this lab, where you will learn how to automate infrastructure and application deployment with minimal inputs using Google Cloud. This hands-on experience leverages Google Cloud Build and Google Cloud Deploy to automate the deployment and management of infrastructure on Google Cloud.

As an SRE or Platform Engineer, this lab equips you with essential skills to improve reliability, scalability, and maintainability of your infrastructure based on the needs of developers while aligning with modern DevOps best practices.

As a developer you often have to deal with a lot of things that are not writing code such as infrastructure provisioning, manually deploying your code perform AB testing. This lab is designed to show you how to remove that burden off the shoulders of Developers using GCP. 

This lab works with the following core concepts:

***Platform Engineering***<br>
Platform engineering focuses on creating and managing the underlying infrastructure that enables developers and operations teams to deliver software efficiently, reliably, and at scale. 

***Application Factory***<br>
A system or platform that allows organizations to rapidly build and deploy multiple applications quickly and efficiently

## Lab
In this lab, you will take on two personas: <strong>Platform Engineer</strong> and <strong>Developer</strong>.
This project represents the live, production environment. Platform Engineers will deploy and manage resources within this project, while Developers will have access to monitor and verify the deployed applications and infrastructure.
This project will be used by both Platform Engineer![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png) who will deploy resources, and Developer ![usr2](img/qwiklabs-icons-2-small.drawio.png) will access the resources.


| <strong>Resources</strong>| <strong>Platform Engineer Tasks</strong> ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)| <strong>Developer Tasks</strong>![usr2](img/qwiklabs-icons-2-small.drawio.png)|
|--------| ----------------- | --------- |
| Git Repository üê±|  **‚Ä¢** Create a new branch for infrastructure updates. <br> **‚Ä¢** Define environment variables for the deployment (e.g., image tag, replica counts). <br> **‚Ä¢** Modify Kubernetes deployment YAMLs to implement Canary deployment (e.g., using Deployment and Service objects). <br> **‚Ä¢** Commit and push changes to [trigger](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automating-builds/create-manage-triggers) the Cloud Build pipeline. | **‚Ä¢** Validate, Read, Write and Push code changes to the repository. |
|Application Code (Online Boutique) | **‚Ä¢** No direct modification of application code. | **‚Ä¢** Make code changes to the Online Boutique application. <br>**‚Ä¢** Build and test the changes locally. <br>**‚Ä¢** Commit and push code changes to a separate application repository (this may trigger a different build/deploy pipeline for staging).<br>**‚Ä¢** Observe the impact of code changes on the production Canary (e.g., through logs, metrics, and user feedback). |
| Cloud Build | **‚Ä¢** Configure [Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/overview) triggers to automatically build and deploy application updates to the GKE cluster. <br>**‚Ä¢** Utilize environment variables within Cloud Build to control deployment parameters. |  No direct interaction with Cloud Build. | 
|GKE Cluster | **‚Ä¢**  Deploy the updated application to the [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/kubernetes-engine-overview) cluster using a Canary deployment strategy.<br>**‚Ä¢** Monitor the Canary deployment rollout and application health using Google Cloud Console or kubectl.<br>**‚Ä¢** Observe traffic distribution between the two versions of the application. |  No direct access to the GKE cluster. |



## Objectives

As a Platform Engineer ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png), you are tasked with building automated CI/CD pipelines with Cloud Build and Terraform, deploying applications to various environments using [Cloud Deploy](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/overview) and environment variables, and performing and monitoring canary deployments on GKE. 

As a Developer ![usr2](img/qwiklabs-icons-2-small.drawio.png), you are tasked to modify code and analyze the application deployed in the current environment.

### Steps:
**Before you start:** You'll need a Cloud Source Repository to store the application code and configuration files.

## Update the repository.  ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

Update the Repository to perform the next task in the Lab. <strong>Run</strong> the Following command in <strong>host project Cloud Shell</strong>. 

<strong>Note: </strong>
 - Platform Engineer needs to execute the  following command to proceed ahead and replace the `project-id`, `user_email` and `user_name` mentioned in the lab instructions tab. <br>
 Example : <br>
 <strong>user_email :</strong> `student-01-f25be5766c74@qwiklabs.net`<br>
 <strong>user_name  :</strong> `student-01-f25be5766c74`

```
 export PROJECT_ID=project-id
 export USER_EMAIL=user_email
 export USER=user_name
```
```
gcloud source repos clone qwiklab-developer-experience --project=$PROJECT_ID
gcloud source repos clone developer-experience --project=qwiklabs-resources
```
```
cd qwiklab-developer-experience
cp -rvf  ../developer-experience/* .
git add -A
git config user.email "$USER_EMAIL"
git config user.name "$USER"
git commit -m "initial commit" -a
git push -o nokeycheck origin main
```

## Explore the resource in the Project ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)
Once you login as a user in the Platform Engineer Chrome profile![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png), You will be able view your project, you can find the project ID in the left sidebar of the lab interface.

In this Section you are going to explore the pre-created resources that require in the next steps.
Now, that you have logged as a <strong>Platform Engineer</strong> in the project.

   --substitutions=_ENV=prod,_PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_ID,_TF_BUCKET_NAME=$TF_BUCKET_NAME
 ```  

 2. Run the below command in cloud shell to excute infra trigger.

```
   gcloud beta builds triggers run terraform-infra-trigger --project=$PROJECT_ID --branch=main --region=us-central1
 ```
3. Navigate to the <strong>cloud build</strong> using <strong>Navigate Menu</strong> .
4. click on <strong>history</strong>.
5. You can find the <strong>terraform-infra-trigger</strong> logs. 

**Trigger: terraform-infra-trigger**

   * The trigger gets activated when you trigger it manually, this trigger executes the `qwiklabs-tf\terraform\env\cloudbuild-infra.yaml` file.
   * Terraform scripts (main.tf, terraform.tfvars, variables.tf) define the infrastructure.
   * Terraform uses a tfstate file to track the current state of the infrastructure.
   * The cloudbuild-infra.yaml configures Terraform to store the tfstate file in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket, ensuring state persistence and collaboration.
   ```

      - |
        terraform apply -input=false -auto-approve
    id: terraform apply
    entrypoint: sh
   ```
   * Following resources are created in this step using terraform scripts.
      * Terraform creates essential cloud resources:
         * API enablement.
         * Service accounts and IAM roles.
         * Virtual Private Cloud ([VPC](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc)), [subnets](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/subnets), [NAT](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview), [routers](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/router/concepts/overview), and [elastic IPs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/configure-static-external-ip-address).
         * [Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/store-docker-container-images).
         * Virtual Machines ([VMs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances)) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters.
         * Secrets in [Secrets Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/creating-and-accessing-secrets).
         * [Firewall](https://cloud.google.com/firewall/docs/firewalls) Rules.
   * The overall goal is to establish the foundational infrastructure required for application deployment, with terraform managing the state of the infrastructure, all executed by cloud build.

## Task 3. Update the GKE Cluster ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

1. In the <strong>Google Cloud console</strong>, Use the navigation menu on the left side of the console to locate <strong>Kubernetes Engine</strong> It's under <strong>Cluster</strong>

   <img src="img/service-mesh.png" alt="service mesh" width="600.00">

## Task 4. Create Application Deployment Cloud build Trigger Resource ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)
In this step let's create one cloud build trigger that will create 3 Cloud build trigger, to deploy the online boutique application.

Execute the below command in cloud shell. 

```
  gcloud builds triggers create manual --name="terraform-cloud-build-trigger" \
   --description="create three cloud build trigger." \
   --service-account="projects/$PROJECT_ID/serviceAccounts/prod-sa@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
   --repo="https://source.developers.google.com/p/$PROJECT_ID/r/qwiklab-developer-experience" \
   --repo-type=CLOUD_SOURCE_REPOSITORIES  \
   --region="us-central1" \
   --branch="main" \
   --build-config="qwiklabs-tf/terraform/env/cloud-build/cloud-build.yaml" \
   --substitutions=_ENV=prod,_REPO_NAME=qwiklab-developer-experience,_PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_ID,_TF_BUCKET_NAME=$TF_BUCKET_NAME
 ```  

```
   gcloud beta builds triggers run terraform-cloud-build-trigger --project=$PROJECT_ID --branch=main --region=us-central1
 ```

3. Navigate to the <strong>cloud build</strong> using <strong>Navigate Menu</strong> .
4. click on <strong>history</strong>.
5. You can find the <strong>terraform-cloud-build-trigger</strong> logs. 

**Trigger: terraform-cloud-build-trigger**
   * Once The terraform-cloud-build-trigger is initiated.
   * Cloud Build executes the steps defined in `qwiklabs-tf/terraform/env/cloud-build/cloud-build.yaml`.
   * The terraform code and the `cloudbuild.yaml` file are in the same directory.
   * Similar to the previous trigger, the `cloud-build.yaml` file likely includes steps for:
      * terraform init: To initialize the Terraform working directory.
      * terraform apply: To create the three Cloud Build triggers.
      * The yaml file will contain the steps to execute the terraform commands.
   * The cloud-build.yaml file contains Terraform commands that define the creation of three Cloud Build triggers:
      1. **cloud-deploy-trigger**
      2. **application-deployment-trigger**
      3. **canary-deployment-trigger**
   * Terraform successfully creates the three specified Cloud Build triggers.
   * All the of terraform scripts that are used to create three trigger are present on this directory `qwiklabs-tf/terraform/env/cloud-build/ `, In those scripts you can view in detail how the triggers are created using terraform.
   * Below is the values file of terraform script which was created for trigger creation, In below code block we have provided values for first trigger (cloud-deploy-trigger) likewise other two triggers are created.
      
      ```
      cloud_build_main_branch_cloud_deploy_trigger = {
      name        = "cloud-deploy-trigger"
      description = "cloud build trigger for Cloud Deploy"
      uri         = "CODE_REPOSITORY_NAME"
      location    = "us-central1"
      branch      = "main"
      path        = "qwiklabs-tf/terraform/env/cloud-deploy/cloud-deploy.yaml"
      service_account = "projects/PROJECT_ID_/serviceAccounts/prod-sa@PROJECT_ID_.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      disabled        = true
      substitutions   = {   "_TF_BUCKET_NAME"="_TF_BUCKET_NAME_",
                              "_PROJECT_ID"="PROJECT_ID_"
                           "_ENV"="_ENV_"
                        }
      }
      ```
   * Immediately after creating the triggers, the <strong>cloud-deploy-trigger</strong> is automatically activated. This is likely configured within the Terraform code or the Cloud Build trigger definition itself.


## Check Deployed Resource ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)
In this step you will check the deployed resources.
1. Use <strong>Platform Engineer</strong> Chrome profile.
2. In the <strong>Google Cloud console</strong>, Use the navigation menu on the left side of the console to locate <strong>Kubernetes Engine</strong> It's under <strong>Cluster</strong>
3. Select  <strong>Cluster Name</strong> to view the Cluster configuration running in your environment.
4. Explore the networking configuration in the  <strong>VPC network</strong> section of the Google Cloud console. Understand how the VM instance(s) are connected to the network and firewall rules in place
5. Navigate to the <strong>Cloud Build</strong> section and click on <strong>triggers</strong>.
6. Select the region <strong>us-central1</strong> to your triggers.
7. You can see the <strong>cloud-deploy-trigger, application-deployment-trigger, and canary-deployment-trigger</strong> along with other build pipeline. 
8. Search for <strong>Cloud deploy</strong> in search bar and click on <strong>Cloud deploy</strong>. You can see the delivery pipeline, which is used to deploy the application on the GKE cluster.

**Triggers: cloud-deploy-trigger**

   * The cloud-deploy-trigger is activated, likely immediately following the successful creation of the triggers by the terraform-cloud-build-trigger.
   * Cloud Build begins executing the steps defined in `qwiklabs-tf/terraform/env/cloud-deploy/cloud-deploy.yaml.`
   * The cloud-deploy.yaml file contains Terraform code that defines the creation of Deploy delivery pipeline and GKE target.
   * This setup configures Cloud Deploy to manage the deployment of the Online Boutique application to the specified GKE cluster.
   *  All the of terraform scripts that are used to create Deploy delivery pipeline and GKE target are present on this directory `qwiklabs-tf/terraform/env/cloud-build/` , In those scripts you can view in detail how the triggers are created using terraform.
   * Immediately after the Cloud Deploy infrastructure is created, the application-deployment-trigger is automatically activated. This initiates the actual deployment of the Online Boutique application.


**Triggers: application-deployment-trigger**
   * Once the application-deployment-trigger is activated, Cloud Build begins executing the steps defined in `online-boutique-repository/cloud-build.yaml`.
   * In the cloud-build.yaml of cloud-deploy-trigger a step is defined to create images, push them to Artifact Registry.
   * Once the Images are pushed into Artifact Registry, In Next step deployments start using skaffold file, which is present in same directory.
   * Below is the code snippet used to pushed images on AR and trigger of the Cloud deploy pipeline by using skaffold.yaml.
   ```
   - id: 'Deploy application to cluster'
   name: 'gcr.io/k8s-skaffold/skaffold:v2.13.2'
   entrypoint: 'bash'
   args:
   - '-c'
   - |
      cd online-boutique-repository
      ls
      services=("emailservice" "productcatalogservice" "recommendationservice" "shippingservice" "checkoutservice" "paymentservice" "currencyservice" "frontend" "adservice" "cartservice" "loadgenerator")

      # Iterate over the services to build and push each image
      for service in "${services[@]}"
         do
         echo "Building and pushing $service..."
         # replacing project id in the image.
         sed -e "s/PROJECT_ID/${_PROJECT_ID}/g" kubernetes-manifests/$service.yaml.tpl > kubernetes-manifests/$service.yaml;
         # removing .tpl file
         rm kubernetes-manifests/$service.yaml.tpl
         done
      gcloud deploy releases create "labs-release-$(date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S')" --project=${_PROJECT_ID} --region=us-central1 --skaffold-file=skaffold.yaml --delivery-pipeline=qwiklabs-delivery-pipeline --skaffold-version=skaffold_preview
   ```
   * In skaffold.yaml, Deployment is done by [skaffold](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/using-skaffold) using kubectl commands, all the [manifest files](https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/using-skaffold/managing-manifests) path is mentioned in below snippet.
   ```
   manifests:
   kustomize:
      paths:
      - kubernetes-manifests
   deploy:
   kubectl: {}
  ```
  * This trigger will complete application deployment of Version 1.


## Task 4. Update Secret in Secret Manager ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)
1. Search for <strong>Secret Manager</strong> on the GCP Console <strong>Search Box</strong>.
2. Navigate to the <strong>Secrets</strong>, you can find a secret named as <strong>"secret"</strong> already present in secret manager.

## Task 5. Configure environment variable in canary deployment Cloud build Trigger ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)
1. Navigate to the <strong>Cloud Build</strong> section and click on <strong>triggers</strong>.
2. Select the region <strong>"us-central1"</strong> for your triggers.
3. Click on the trigger name which is created initially step<strong>(canary-deployment-trigger)</strong>.
4. In Event Choose <strong>Push to branch</strong>.
5. Under <strong>Advance section</strong> and <strong>Substitution variables</strong>, click on add variables and fill the below details:

   | <strong>Variables</strong>| <strong>Value</strong>| 
   |---------------------------| --------------------- | 
   | _PROJECT_ID               | your-project-id       | 
   | _V1_TRAFFIC               | number                | 
   | _V2_TRAFFIC               | number                | 

   <ql-infobox>
      <strong>_V2_TRAFFIC </strong> : 25 <br> 
      <strong>_V1_TRAFFIC </strong> : 75 <br> 
      <strong>Your-project-id</strong> : Project ID present in lab Instruction <br> 
   </ql-infobox>

6. Click on <strong>Save</strong>.

**Trigger: canary-deployment-trigger**
   * This Trigger gets automatically triggered when codes are pushed to the repository.
   * First step of this trigger is to build and push new productcatalogservice to Artifact Registry.
   * Once images are pushed to Artifact Registry we will add a label version=v1 to the productcatalog deployment.
   * The Service Mesh which was enabled in previous steps will be used here to split traffic.
   * This trigger uses kubectl commands to apply manifest file required to split traffic, you can view all the manifest files under `online-boutique-repository/traffic-split-manifest/`.
   * `destination-vs-v1.yaml` will deploy your [VirtualService](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/virtual-service/) and [DestinationRule](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/destination-rule/) for v1 of productcatalog.
   * `productcatalog-v2.yaml.tpl` has productcatalogservice-v2 which introduces a new service with 3-second latency into requests on the EXTRA_LATENCY field.
   * `destination-v1-v2.yaml` uses DestinationRule to specify the subsets of a service. here we have a subset for v1 productcatalogservice and then a separate subset for v2 of productcatalogservice.
   * `vs-split-traffic.yaml.tpl` uses VirtualService to define a small percentage of the traffic to direct to v2 of the productcatalogservice.
   * This completes the implemention a canary deployment strategy using a service mesh.

## Task 5. Make Changes in Application Factory ![usr2](img/qwiklabs-icons-2-small.drawio.png)

   <ql-infobox>
   <strong>Note:</strong> Before performing this step it is recommended to switch the Chrome profile of a Developer
   </ql-infobox>
<br>
In this step you will modify the application code and push to repository.

1. On the Top right corner you can see a icon of <strong>Cloud shell</strong>, Click on the Cloud shell icon, GCP provision a <strong>Cloud shell instance</strong> which would have all the necessary packages pre installed.

2. Once you connect to <strong>Cloud shell instance</strong>, you can see a Terminal, on top of terminal you can find a <strong>Open Editor</strong> button, press that and you can see a <strong>Cloud shell editor</strong> similar to VS Code.

3. Once you are connected you can clone the  <strong>Application Repository </strong> using git clone command, you can copy this command and paste it on the  <strong>cloud shell terminal </strong>.  
<strong><i>gcloud source repos clone online-boutique-repository --project=(Enter your project ID)</i> </strong>.

4. Checkout in main branch and left panel you able to view all the codes on the editor, you need to copy the whole folder <i>src/productcatalogservice</i> and copy on the same directory, and rename the folder as <i>productcatalogservice-v2</i>.

5. Goto this file  <strong><i>src/productcatalogservice-v2/products.json</i></strong> and edit the name of "Tank Top for Women","Watch for men" add descrition  <strong>"SALE!!! SALE!!! SALE!!!." </strong> .

6. Once edit is done you can do the CSR.
   <strong>"git add ."
   "git commit -m "code added" "
   "git push origin main" </strong>

7. Automatic Canary Deployment cloud build triggered and Deploy the latest changes. Navigate to the <strong>Cloud build</strong> and validate the cloud build logs under <strong>history</strong> tab. 

## Task 6. Evaluate Canary deployment ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

 1. **Navigate to Kubernetes Engine:** Click on the <strong>Navigation menu (‚ò∞)</strong> on the left side of the console to locate <strong>"GKE Cluster"</strong>. It's under <strong>"Kubernetes Engine"</strong>.
 2. **Select Your Cluster:** Locate and select the same cluster associated with this application.
 <br><br>
 <img src="img/service-mesh.png" alt="service mesh" width="400.00">
 <br><br>

 3. You can find Service mesh Dashboard endpoint on the bottom of Cluster Details.

 4. You will be able to see visuals of Service Mesh topology of Current application on this section, you can also view the traffic splitting.

## Task 7. Monitor Traffic change between the two deployments ![usr2](img/qwiklabs-icons-2-small.drawio.png)

1. **Navigate to Kubernetes Engine:** Click on the <strong>Navigation menu (‚ò∞)</strong> on the left side of the console to locate <strong>"Kubernetes Engine"</strong>. It's under <strong>"Clusters"</strong>.

2. **Select Your Cluster:** click on the GKE cluster name associated with this application.

3. On the Left Pane, Click on the <strong>Gateway,Services & Ingress</strong> Once you clicked you can see <strong>Gateway, Routes, Services and Ingress</strong>.

4. You need to click on <strong>"Services"</strong> and details of all the running services for the application is available with IP's, you can find the <strong>frontend</strong> service  Ip address here.

   <img src="img/GKE-Servicess.png" alt="gce-dropdown" width="400.00">
   <br></br>

5. Paste the Ip address on your Chrome Browser and you can verify the traffic split.

   OR 

   You can use the below command under service project cloud shell.
   ```      
   export SERVICE_PROJECT_ID=service-project-id
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials qwiklabs-developer-1-cluster --region us-central1 --project $SERVICE_PROJECT_ID
   kubectl get services frontend-external
   ```

6. When you refresh the page, as we have set a <strong>75/25 Split</strong>, you can see <strong>v2 deployment</strong> after every <strong>4th</strong> page refresh.

7. For the First Three Refresh, you will see the below webpage image.

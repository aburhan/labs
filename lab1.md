# Building a Platform with IaC + GitOps

## Overview
Welcome to this lab, where you'll learn to build and manage enterprise-grade cloud environments using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps methodology. Through hands-on experience with Terraform and Google Cloud Build, you'll automate infrastructure deployment and management on Google Cloud. This lab is designed for Infrastructure Admins and Platform Engineers, this lab provides essential skills to enhance infrastructure reliability, scalability, and maintainability while following modern DevOps best practices. As enterprise infrastructures grow in complexity, Platform Engineering and GitOps are becoming key approaches to streamlining the development and operations lifecycle, resulting in improved developer experience and feature velocity.

**Platform Engineering**

Platform engineering streamlines software delivery by building and managing self-service infrastructure platforms by providing users of the platform "golden paths". Golden paths abstract away infrastructure complexities and processes, empowering developers with the tools and flexibility they need to concentrate on feature development. For example, in this lab the platform provides a golden path allowing the developer to build and deploy application changes without needing to interact with the underlying infrastructure.

**GitOps**

GitOps manages infrastructure and applications declaratively, using Git as the central source of truth. It leverages Git's features like pull requests and workflows to automate and control deployments.

## Lab
This unique lab requires students to assume the roles (personas)  of both Platform Engineer and Developer, working across multiple GCP projects.  Three distinct GCP Projects are pre-created at the start of the Lab (detailed in the table below)

| <strong>Project Type</strong>|    <strong>Project Name</strong> |     <strong>Purpose</strong> |
|:--------:| :-----------------: | :--------- |
| Seed üå± | qwiklabs-gcp**. | This project grants exclusive access to the Platform Engineer for the administration of IaC Pipelines. This project has the IaC pipelines to manage the non-prod environment, prod environment and spin up new environments. This project will be used by the Platform Engineer to manage the infrastructure in the Non-Prod  and Prod  projects |
| Non-Prod ‚öôÔ∏è | qwiklabs-gcp**. | This project serves as a development environment for the purpose of testing and verifying application modifications prior to their deployment into the production environment. Please note:  Once you start the Lab all required resources for the Non-Prod environment are predeployed including Applications |
| Prod üè≠ | qwiklabs-gcp** | This project, similar to the Non-Prod project, provides resources for developers to deploy their applications. However, this project is specifically used for handling production traffic. |

## Personas

| <strong>Role/Persona</strong>| <strong>Tasks</strong> |
|--------| ----------------- |
| Platform Engineer (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png) | The platform engineer will leverage existing IaC automation scripts to deploy new production environments, implementing automated CI/CD pipelines using Cloud Build triggers to adhere to GitOps principles and simplify the production platform setup. |
| Developer ![usr2](img/qwiklabs-icons-2-small.drawio.png) | The Developer will confirm the deployed web application's functionality via a web browser and analyze its performance metrics using the monitoring dashboard. |

## Objectives

As a Platform Engineer (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png), your task is to evaluate the existing infrastructure in the Non-Prod Project ‚öôÔ∏è and then use the Seed project's üå± automated pipelines to provision similar resources in the Prod environment üè≠. 

As a Developer ![usr2](img/qwiklabs-icons-2-small.drawio.png), your responsibility is to evaluate the deployed application's performance and functionality in both the Production üè≠ and Non-Production environments ‚öôÔ∏è.

### Architecture

### Before you click the Start Lab button

   This is an advanced lab, it is designed for Platform Engineers / Infrastructure Engineers / Site Reliability Engineers (SREs), this lab assumes you have:

   1. Basic knowledge of Terraform syntax and configuration files.
   2. Familiarity with CI/CD concepts.
   3. An understanding of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) fundamentals, including IAM, networking, and Compute Engine.

## Task 1. Prepare your environment (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

In this task, you create separate Chrome profiles for each persona and start the lab.

This lab includes navigating between multiple projects and multiple user personas. To simplify navigating between projects setup environment variables

1. Sign in using the Platform Engineer username {{{ user_1.username }}} and password {{{ user_1.password }}}

2. On the Google Cloud console title bar, click **Activate Cloud shell**
   ![Activate Cloud Shell](img/cloudshell.png)

## Task 2. Configure your project in Cloud Shell (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png)

In this task, you set environment variables and clone the sample repositories.

1. In Cloudshell, set environment variables

   <ql-code-block language="bash" templated>
   export SEED_PROJECT_ID={{{project_0.project_id|'[SEED_PROJECT_ID]'}}}
   export REGION={{{project_0.default_region|'[REGION]'}}}
   export USER_EMAIL={{{user_1.username|['PLATFORM_ENG_PERSONA_EMAIL]'}}}
   export USER={{{user_1.local_username|['PLATFORM_ENG_PERSONA_USERNAME]'}}}
   export DEST_REPO=app-repo
   </ql-code-block>

2. Clone the infrastructure and application repos:

   ```sh
   gcloud source repos clone building-platform-with-iac --project=qwiklabs-resources
   gcloud source repos create "$DEST_REPO" --project="$SEED_PROJECT_ID"
   cd building-platform-with-iac && git checkout main && cd ../
   gcloud source repos clone "$DEST_REPO" --project="$SEED_PROJECT_ID" && cd $DEST_REPO
   ```

3. Copy the starter files and push your initial commit:

   ```sh
    git config user.email "$USER_EMAIL"
    git config user.name "$USER"
    ../building-platform-with-iac/repo-setup.sh
   ```

## Task 3. Grant Access and Configure Cloud build Trigger for Non-Prod Environment
Once you login as a Platform Engineer (Platform Engineer) ![usr1](img/qwiklabs-icons1-small.drawio.png), You will be able to choose between 4 projects. You have to identify the üå± seed project, by using the üå±Seed project id mentioned in the left sidebar of the lab

   1. Now that you have logged as a <strong>Platform Engineer</strong> in and selected the seed project.
   2. Go to the IAM section.
   3. Find a service account named <strong>seed-sa</strong> and copy the email of the service account we will use it later.
      * Note that This service account will have Storage Admin and Logging Admin access.

      <img src="img/IAM2.png" alt="IAM" width="600.00">
